# Rohlíkulačka II 

- Rohlikulacka the second is new version of [Rohlikulacka](https://github.com/GosutoDev/Rohlikulacka). It is an app that calculate final invoice for delivering orders in Rohlik company.

## The problem

- I work as food delivery guy for customers and the big problem is that the company itself not giving accurate invoice earn or some earnings is missing. The company doing things differently. I have decided to change that for my own purposes and to learn some new things about Swift. I am actively using first version of [Rohlikulacka](https://github.com/GosutoDev/Rohlikulacka).
- I wanted an API from Rohlik but it was declined from them. The API contain some unsecured data, that they don't wanted to show to the public. Acceptable.

## Solution

- The first thing why I decided to build an app for calculating an invoice, that I don't want to write all details about orders to Excel. I wanted two or three buttons and done! Final earn per month has showed up! Excellent.
The app makes it easier to live. Like I said, two buttons and everything is calculated prefectly.

## Why another version

- Well, the [Rohlikulacka](https://github.com/GosutoDev/Rohlikulacka) is my first big project ever. The code is not maintainable, it is a mess. That year when I was building it, I was learning and I was very beginner.
The code that I "write" is was rather copy and paste. So I wanted to rebuild the entire app by every piece. Today I can say that it has potential, but is it enought?
